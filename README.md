# Linker Scripts 101 tutorial.

I uploaded it because was asked to. Not meant to be the project of the century.

Supposed to be almost 1-1 compatible with the videos at https://youtu.be/hTejqS7jVJk. 
However since I did it on the fly, and constructed the git tree later, there may be some negligible differences.

I put some detour information in other branches.
